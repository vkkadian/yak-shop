yak-shop
========

Yak shepherd living on the tundra herding a group of Yaks. Every once in a while he gets customers who come in to buy Yak wool or milk from him. However he decides to open up a shop on the internet so that he can expand his horizon and actually sell his products outside of his regular clientele. He decided to hire me as a developer for his new web shop. Therefore, I have created this simple JEE and RESTful based application to demonstrate some of the architecturally most significant use cases to him.
